# Beyond Integration: SuperGLUE Facilitates Explainable Training Framework for Multi-modal Data Analysis

This is the official implementation of **SuperGLUE**, which is an improved version of GLUE. **SuperGLUE** has better integration performances, and it is also capable of integrating arbitary numbers and arbitary omics by addressing [this issue](https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE/pull/114). **SuperGLUE** has a statistical test framework to identify significant feature interaction.

## Install

Please refer [GLUE](https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE) to prepare the necessary environments for running. 

To find the relationships between cell states and features, please install shap:

```
pip install shap
or
conda install -c conda-forge shap
```
